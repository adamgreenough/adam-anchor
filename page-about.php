					<p>On the rare occasion I get some free time I enjoy being on the water, anything that will float; playing the piano, attempting to at least; and spending time with my girlfriend, Sasha.</p>
					
					<p>As a digital native, I have always been fascinated by the limitless possibilities of the internet. I aspire to use my passion for the medium to be a part of something that changes the world for the better, one day. :v::peace:</p>
