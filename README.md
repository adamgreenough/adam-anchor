# Adam Greenough

This is an Anchor CMS theme for my [personal website](https://adamgreenough.com/).

Through experimental, art-directed blogging, I hope that this site can become my design & development proving ground with this repo as the  proof.

Find out more about Anchor CMS [here](https://anchorcms.com/).

The master branch of this repo automatically pushes live using [FTPloy](https://ftploy.com).
